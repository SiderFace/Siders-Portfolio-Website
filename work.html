                     This is another movie database app, for users to explore a list of movies, and add them to their own personal profile's "Favorites" list.  
                     It is, essentially, a recreation of the 'MyFlix DB' app that is presented above in this protfolio, but now is developed from the ground up using Anuglar.
                     It sources the same movie database, and also uses API calls in a manner appropriate to Angular logic.
                     Users can, again, register with the app to create a personal profile, and their login info can also be used on the 'MyFlix DB' React app.  
                     One notable UI difference is that Movie cards have the three information categories immediately accessible to be clicked on the main movie page, where they will pop up a modal with the selected information; as opposed to clicking the card to be brought to a separate component view with all of the information in one view.

                  <P>
                     The app generates a chat icon for each user based on teh initials of their selected username.  
                     The background of the chat window is generated with teh color selected by the user.  
                     File sharing is mad epossible by the firestore cloud storage that hosts the shared access point where all connected users can send and receive messages, images, and locations.  
                     Asynchronous data storage allows for any chat data that was sent before a user loses internet connectivity to remain visible to the user.  
                     The chat is equipped to utilize the users' device GPS capabilities to share their location with other users.  
                     Users will always be prompted to give permission to the app to access their camera, file (images) storage, and location (GPS) to ensure trust and privacy.  
                  </P>

                     Users of the To-do List App can utilize this classic tool to make a log of items that can be crossed off or removed at their discretion.  
                     Users simply type in the item they want to add to the list into the given text input field, and click "Add".  
                     They can click the "X" beside each listed item to remove it, or double-click the item to have it remain listed but crossed off.  
                     A simple yet great way to keep track of things otherwise easy to forget.
