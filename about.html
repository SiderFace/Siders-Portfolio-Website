               Hello, I'm Sean Siders, an aspiring web developer fueled by a passion for technology and a diverse professional journey.  
               From early experiments with HTML in the late '90s to exploring the great outdoors after high school, my path led me to study networking at Kent State University.  
               However, life took a turn when I fell in love and became a father. Seeking stability, I transitioned to sales and found success in manufacturing supervision, 
               specializing in project planning and process optimization. But the allure of technology, coupled with a supportive environment, prompted a career shift.  
               Now, with my wife's success providing a foundation, I'm returning to my roots. My aim is to collaborate with teams in developing software and web solutions.  
               My strengths lie in interpersonal communication, efficiency optimization, and a passion for technology. I've honed these skills in roles spanning sales, project management, 
               and process engineering.  Outside of work, you'll find me exploring hobbies like running, fitness, disc golf, gaming, and enjoying music and creative writing.  
               I bring this rich tapestry of experiences to my goal of becoming a web developer, ready to contribute to projects that improve efficiency and user experiences.  
               As I embark on this journey, my unique blend of skills and interests align with my goal of becoming a key player in a team dedicated to creating impactful software solutions.  
               I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead, where I can bridge the gap between technology and the diverse needs of end-users.
